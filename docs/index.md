Welcome to the fermi_proj documentation site!

The documentation site reflects the most recently changed (that is pushed) version of the project.

This means that you are encouraged to reinstall to the next major version when it rolls out ASAP since there will not be any documentation online to reference again.

Needs volunteers! Please please pleaseeee
